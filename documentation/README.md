Overview

This project implements an Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic Library in Java that supports both integers and floating-point numbers. The library provides functionality for performing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on very large numbers, which are beyond the limits of primitive data types.
Features

    Support for Arbitrary-Precision Integers: Allows performing operations on integers with arbitrary size.

    Support for Arbitrary-Precision Floating-Point Numbers: Performs operations on floating-point numbers with a variable level of precision.

    Operations Supported:

        Addition

        Subtraction

        Multiplication

        Division

    Modular Design: The library is divided into separate components (e.g., AInteger, AFloat) for better modularity and ease of maintenance.

    This project implements the arithmetic from scratch, without relying on BigInteger or BigDecimal.
